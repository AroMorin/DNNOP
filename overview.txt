Main steps in the AdvN algorithm
1) Init pool
2) Evaluate pool
3) Rank pool
4) Set anchors
  a) eliminate duplicate performances?
  b) ensure minimum distance is observed
5) Set elite
6) Set/Apply Backtracking
7) Set probes
  a) clone anchors
  b) apply blends
9) Apply perturbations
10) Update Neural Network weights
11) Go to step 2


Proposals to make it better:

1) Targeted updates using a correlation matrix
2) Investigating small-world and alternative network architectures
3) Using eager optimization, instead of fixed-size generations
4) Using single-agent optimization with memory and curiosity
