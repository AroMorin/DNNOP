# Neuroevolution-based Optimization of DNNs
A repo containing the implementation of neuroevolution algorithms that are
developed to train deep neural networks. The repo features some environments such
as Atari, and the accompanying solving scripts in "solvers" using the provided
optimization algorithms. The optimization algorithms can be used in tandem with
SGD or separately.

In this repository, we use "trunk-based" development. This basically defines that
updates are always incremental and continuous. Features are integrated constantly
into the repo, rather than in batches.

In addition, the scripts are formatted using YAPF following Google style. They
are always lint checked using pylint, as well. Naming conventions for Python
should be followed, within reason.
