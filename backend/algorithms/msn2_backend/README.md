This directory contains the implementation of the Advanced Neuroevolution
algorithm. This algorithm is based on the idea of searching multiple regions
in the search space simultaneously. This considerably speeds up the searching
process. The algorithm is directly developed to work with deep neural networks.
Its search space is the space of weight values.
